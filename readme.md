# hierarchical-menu
Realization of hierarchical terminal menu using delegates. 

A bit naive project, I created it before I knew about delegate pattern, or codestyle for that matter. 

I am thinking about recreating normal wersion of this project using java someday.

## How it works
Each menu has list of options. Menu can have multiple options, each option represents either menu or method.

You can see how hard it can be used in Program.cs.
